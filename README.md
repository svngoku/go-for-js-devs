# Go for JavaScript Developers

In this repo, you will learn more about about Golang and how it works

## Story

The `Go` language was created by `Google` for system programming and has since been extended to applications. It is an imperative and concurrent language. Its compilation speed (due to the simplicity of its syntax) makes it sometimes used as a scripting language.

`Go` aims to make `large-scale programming easier` and `faster`: because of its `simplicity`, it can be used for writing `applications`, `scripts` or `large systems`.
This simplicity is also necessary to ensure the maintenance and evolution of programs over several generations of developers.

If he also aims for speed of execution, which is essential for system programming, he considers multithreading to be the most robust way of ensuring this speed on today's processors while making maintenance easy by separating simple tasks that are executed independently in order to avoid creating "gas factories". This design also allows operation without rewriting on multi-core architectures by immediately exploiting the corresponding power increase.

## Installation

- Install Go on your machine
  - If you are using a MacBook, use `brew install go`

- Visit the ![golang](https://go.dev/dl/)

- If you already have Go installed, feel free to skip installation or find the section below called Upgrading To Go 1.13.

following commands:

```sh
which go
=> /usr/local/go
```

```sh
go version
=>go version go1.13.1 darwi/amd64
```

#### Modify Your PATH 

1. Go checks for a certain environment variable, `GOPATH` when executing a Go program. We need to update our bash_profile to help Go find where our files will live.

2. In a code editor, open up your `.bash_profile` which should be located in your home directory. 

3. Add the following lines to the bottom of the file (or wherever you export your PATH environment variables)

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
```

#### Verify These Updates

1. Restart your terminal

2. Run the following commands and verify you see similar output

```bash
echo $PATH
=> ..../usr/local/go/bin: 

echo $GOPATH
=> /Users/brennamartenson/go
```

#### Create a go workspace

We just told Go that whenever we run a Go command in our terminal (ie: `go run main.go`), it should look for those files in the GOPATH, which typically defaults to `/Users/yourusername/go`. 

1. Navigate to your home directory (for me that is `/Users/brennamartenson`), and create a `go` directory with `mkdir go`.

2. Change into the go directory with `cd go`, then `mkdir src`, and change into the directory with `cd src`.

3. Clone the repo for this course into the `go` directory.

`git clone https://github.com/martensonbj/fem-intro-to-go`

#### Verify Everything Is Good To GO ðŸ˜‰

1. Change into the `go/fem-intro-to-go` directory

2. Run `go run main.go`

3. If all went well, you should see `"Hello Front End Masters!"`


### Upgrading to Go 1.13

1. Verify you do have Go installed in the first place:

```bash
go version 
=> go version go1.12.1 darwin/amd64
```

2. Uninstall Go

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

3. Verify Go was uninstalled

```bash
go version
=> -bash: go: command not found
```

4. Visit [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl) to install the latest Go.
